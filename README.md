# Natural Language Processing Project: How to Write a Better Paper
### Jeffrey Bailey

## Project Description
In this project, I seek to use tools and methodology learned in the class to analyze trends in the linguistics and writing styles of academic papers. From this analysis I hope to gain insight into how more successful and accomplished researchers write and arrange their papers so that I may better my own academic writing. This will require scraping of published papers and academic journals as well as computational skills to analyze and quantify linguistic trends. After an academic linguistic data set has been collected and processed, I hope to analyze it for significant trends or tendencies, perhaps by comparing a paper's success with the style of its language. At the end, I plan to assemble and present the my findings into a mock seminar or infographic about succesful tips for academic writing. 

## Steps to be Done
* A source for data must be found, containing both the text within academic papers and some metric of the paper or author's relative success.
* Data must be collected or scraped, and then processed and cleaned into a usable database.
* The processed database must be analyzed statistically, perhaps using techniques or metrics learned later in the NLP course.
* Findings and trends within the data will be statistically tested and graphically visualized, and then compiled into some presentable form.

## Initial Proposal
To keep as a reference, here is my initial project proposal from the February 2nd interest statement:

A potential project topic that is interesting to me is to analyze aspects of linguistics and writing styles within published scientific articles. This is relevant to me because until recently I was a fully focused chemistry major (I now focus on data science), and this semester I will finish writing a paper I have been working on with a W&M professor. However, I don't fully know what kind of questions or applications are applicable for the kind of language processing we will do in this class, I preliminarily plan to research trends between a paper's writing style and its influence in the field. Influence could be quantified using the writer's H-index, the paper's acclaim or earned accolades, or the paper's prevalence or reach into non-scientific media. The work from this project could be used by publishers or scientific authors to analyze their own work. More importantly to me I think it would be interesting to see if any particular writing styles or phrases are more prevalently used by succesful scientists so that I may incorporate those styles into my own work.
